# AWS-CCP-Practices

This repository contains my hands-on experience and exercises for AWS Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) exam preparation. I have worked with a wide range of AWS services to get hands-on exposure and deepen my understanding of the core AWS concepts required for the certification exam.

# Services Covered
The following AWS services were covered as part of the hands-on labs:

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): Setting up, configuring, and managing virtual servers.
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service): Working with object storage for data storage and retrieval.
AWS Lambda: Implementing serverless computing and running code without provisioning or managing servers.
Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): Configuring networking, subnets, route tables, and security groups for isolation and security.
Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service): Sending notifications using topics and subscriptions.
Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service): Implementing message queuing systems for decoupling and scalability.
Amazon CloudWatch: Monitoring and logging services to keep track of system performance and resource usage.
IAM (Identity and Access Management): Configuring permissions and security for AWS services.
Labs and Screenshots
Each folder in this repository contains hands-on exercises corresponding to a specific AWS service. The exercises include screenshots of my actions in the AWS Management Console, configuration settings, and relevant explanations. You can use this as a reference for your own AWS learning journey.
